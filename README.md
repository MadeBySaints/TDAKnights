# TDAKnights
Top Down Adventure Knights is the placeholder name for our game about survival, loot, crafting, and adventure.


This game is in it's early stages and is to be considered incomplete. Most mechanics are missing, and will be implemented over time.
Everything is subject to change at a moments notice without warning.


Feel free to submit pull requests for relevant contributions. We would love for the community to contribute to the project, and help get it off the ground! Any contributions accepted will be accredited properly ;)
